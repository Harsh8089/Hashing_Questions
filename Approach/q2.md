The approach that came to my mind was to find out the largest substring containing equal no. of 0's and 1's.

This question is similar to find length of max substring containing equal no. of 0 and 1.

But the catch over here is to calcuate no. of operation, which can be simply performed by subtracting length of og string by max substring!.
