Greedily, dot product of 2 arrays will be minimized if larger numbers
from one array are multiplied with smaller numbers from the other array and vice versa.

So I sorted
serverCapacity array and mapped the maximum value with minimum value of serverLoad.
Elements of serverLoad mapped with serverCapacity -

For Input: serverLoad = [7, 2, 7, 3], serverCapacity = [5, 1, 4, 6]

7 -> [4, 1] <br>
3 -> [5] <br>
2 -> [6] 

Now for each key, I sorted the list in ascending order. <br>
7 -> [1, 4] <br>
3 -> [5] <br>
2 -> [6] <br>

After that I created an array of size serverLoad and assigned each value by iterating over the map.
